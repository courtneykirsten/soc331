## This class is all about Population and Society

Many social forces are connected to population processes, but what are population processes? The study of population, also known as demography, considers how populations change through processes such as fertility, mortality, and migration. Demographers also consider more complex and emerging population themes, such as aging, kinship, urbanization, and environmental impact of population growth. This class will provide you with the knowledge and tools to understand, discuss, and analyze demographic topics such as population size, age structure, composition, and change. We will use demography to understand terms and basic methods for measuring populations, and we will also use a sociological lens to critically think about the uses of demography and how demography is everywhere around us.

By the end of this class, you will be able to integrate a demographic perspective into the study of social, political, environmental, and economic issues and you will have an expanded set of skills as a social scientist. Course materials and class discussion will help you to become a more informed consumer of news and political reports about issues related to population problems. This class will focus both on forming basic demographic analysis skills as well as strengthening critical reading and writing abilities.

No prior knowledge of sociology or population studies is assumed.
